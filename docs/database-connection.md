## Description

Configure database integration with Supabase PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM to provide robust data access, migrations, and entity management with real-time capabilities.

## Tasks

- [ ] Set up Supabase project and obtain API credentials
- [ ] Configure environment variables for Supabase connection
- [ ] Integrate Prisma ORM with Supabase PostgreSQL
- [ ] Set up database schema management and migrations with Prisma
- [ ] Configure row-level security (RLS) policies in Supabase
- [ ] Create database module in NestJS for Supabase/Prisma integration
- [ ] Implement real-time data subscriptions using Supabase
- [ ] Configure Supabase database extensions if needed
- [ ] Add database health check endpoints
- [ ] Set up error handling for database operations
- [ ] Configure logging for database queries
- [ ] Set up database backup and restoration processes
- [ ] Create seed scripts for initial data
- [ ] Set up a local development environment with Supabase CLI
- [ ] Optimize query performance for Supabase PostgreSQL

## Acceptance Criteria

- Supabase PostgreSQL connection is properly configured with environment variables
- Prisma ORM is correctly integrated with Supabase and provides type-safe queries
- Database schema can be managed and migrated using Prisma migrations
- Row-level security (RLS) policies correctly control data access based on user roles
- Real-time data subscriptions work as expected for relevant tables
- Database module provides a clean abstraction of database operations
- Database errors are properly handled and logged
- Database health check provides meaningful status information
- Database backup and restoration processes are documented and tested
- Seed scripts provide necessary initial data for development and testing
- Local development environment matches production Supabase configuration
- Connection can be tested with simple CRUD operations
- Query performance is optimized for production use

# Plan of Action

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Tasks

1. **Supabase Project Setup**

   - Environment variables configured in .env files
   - Local development environment set up with Supabase directory

2. **Prisma ORM Integration**

   - Prisma configured with PostgreSQL connector
   - schema.prisma defined with basic User model
   - Migrations system set up with initial migration

3. **NestJS Database Module**

   - PrismaService implemented with connection management and logging
   - SupabaseService created with regular and admin clients
   - UsersRepository implemented with CRUD operations

4. **Health Checks**

   - Health module with PrismaHealthIndicator implemented
   - Health controller with endpoints for monitoring database status

5. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - DatabaseErrorInterceptor for handling Prisma errors
   - Query logging configured in development environment

## Updated Plan of Action

### 1. Configure Row-Level Security (RLS)

1. **Enable RLS on Tables**:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE "public"."users" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```

2. **Create RLS Policies**:

   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own data"
   ON "public"."users"
   FOR SELECT
   USING (auth.uid() = id);

   CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own data"
   ON "public"."users"
   FOR UPDATE
   USING (auth.uid() = id);
   ```

3. **Implement RLS-Aware Queries** using the appropriate Supabase clients

### 2. Set up Real-Time Subscriptions

1. **Configure Real-Time in Supabase** for relevant tables
2. **Implement SubscriptionsService** to handle real-time events:

   ```typescript
   @Injectable()
   export class SubscriptionsService {
     constructor(private supabaseService: SupabaseService) {}

     subscribeToTable(tableName: string, callback: (payload: any) => void) {
       const supabase = this.supabaseService.getClient();
       return supabase
         .channel('table-changes')
         .on('postgres_changes', { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: tableName }, callback)
         .subscribe();
     }
   }
   ```

### 3. Configure Database Extensions

1. **Enable Required Extensions**:
   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "pg_stat_statements";
   ```

### 4. Create Seed Scripts

1. **Create prisma/seed.ts** for development data
2. **Add Seed Command** to package.json

### 5. Set up Database Backup and Restoration

1. **Create Backup Script** in scripts/database/backup.ts
2. **Create Restoration Script** in scripts/database/restore.ts
3. **Add Scripts to package.json**

### 6. Optimize Query Performance

1. **Review and Optimize Existing Queries**
2. **Add Performance Monitoring** endpoint using pg_stat_statements

### 7. Testing Database Integration

1. **Create Integration Tests** for repositories and services
2. **Set Up Test Database** configuration

### 8. Additional Enhancements

1. **Automated Schema Documentation** with Prisma-ERD
2. **Implement Soft Delete Pattern** for important entities
3. **Create Database Auditing System** for sensitive operations
4. **Implement Data Privacy Controls** for sensitive fields

This updated plan builds on the solid foundation already in place while addressing the remaining tasks from the original document and suggesting additional enhancements for a more robust implementation.
