## Plan of Action

### 1. Configure Jest for Unit Testing [done]

- Current state: Basic Jest configuration exists, but needs enhancement
- Actions:
  - Update jest-config.json with coverage thresholds and parallel execution settings
  - Add watch mode plugins for improved developer experience
  - Configure collectCoverageFrom with more specific patterns

### 2. Set up Integration Testing Framework []

- Current state: No dedicated integration test setup
- Actions:
  - Create test module builders for NestJS modules
  - Implement integration test utilities for database and external services
  - Add transaction handling for test isolation

### 3. Implement End-to-End Testing with Supertest []

- Current state: Basic e2e config may exist (jest-e2e.json mentioned in scripts)
- Actions:
  - Create or enhance dedicated E2E configuration
  - Add global setup/teardown hooks
  - Implement request/response test helpers using Supertest

### 4. Add Test Coverage Reporting []

- Current state: Basic coverage setup exists
- Actions:
  - Configure Istanbul/NYC for more detailed coverage
  - Set minimum coverage thresholds by category
  - Add HTML report generation for visualization

### 5. Create Test Utilities and Helpers []

- Current state: Some basic utilities exist (config-mocks, logger-mocks)
- Actions:
  - Add comprehensive service mocking utilities
  - Create request simulation helpers
  - Implement logging/trace utilities for debugging tests

### 6. Implement Test Database Setup/Teardown []

- Current state: Test DB config exists in .env.test but no setup/teardown
- Actions:
  - Enhance test database configuration
  - Create database seeders for tests
  - Implement cleanup between test runs

### 7. Add Test Data Factories []

- Current state: No entity factories
- Actions:
  - Implement factory.ts pattern for consistent test data
  - Create entity factories for all domain models
  - Add data randomization utilities

### 8. Configure CI Pipeline for Testing []

- Current state: No visible CI configuration
- Actions:
  - Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
  - Configure test caching for faster runs
  - Implement test reporting in CI

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Enhance Jest Configuration

- Update jest-config.json with coverage thresholds
- Add parallel execution configuration
- Configure watch plugins

### Step 2: Build Test Module Structure

- Create dedicated folders for unit, integration, and e2e tests
- Implement test module builders
- Set up database transaction handling for integration tests

### Step 3: Implement E2E Testing Framework

- Create/enhance jest-e2e.json
- Set up global E2E hooks
- Implement Supertest helpers

### Step 4: Develop Advanced Test Utilities

- Expand the test/utils directory with comprehensive helpers
- Create mock factories for services
- Implement database utilities

### Step 5: Set Up Test Database Handling

- Create scripts for database setup/teardown
- Implement test data seeding
- Add cleanup mechanisms

### Step 6: Implement Test Data Factories

- Create core factory pattern implementation
- Build entity factories
- Add data generation utilities

### Step 7: Add Coverage Reporting

- Configure detailed coverage settings
- Add HTML report generation
- Set appropriate thresholds

### Step 8: Configure CI Pipeline

- Create GitHub Actions workflow files
- Set up caching for dependencies
- Configure test reporting

This structured approach will ensure all requirements are met while building on the existing foundation in your codebase.
